# Boilerplate and Starter for Next.JS in 2023

🚀 Boilerplate and Starter for Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript ⚡️ Made with developer experience first: Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged, Jest, Testing Library, Commitlint, VSCode, Netlify, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS.

Clone this project and use it to create your own [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

### Features

Developer experience first:

- ⚡ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for Static Site Generator
- 🔥 Type checking [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- 💎 Integrate with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- ✅ Strict Mode for TypeScript and React 18
- 📏 Linter with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) (default NextJS, NextJS Core Web Vitals, Tailwind CSS and Airbnb configuration)
- 💖 Code Formatter with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- 🚫 Lint-staged for running linters on Git staged files
- 🚓 Lint git commit with Commitlint
- 📓 Write standard compliant commit messages with Commitizen
- 🦺 Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- 🔍 Visual testing with Percy (Optional)
- 💡 Absolute Imports using `@` prefix
- 🗂 VSCode configuration: Debug, Settings, Tasks and extension for PostCSS, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest
- 🤖 SEO metadata, JSON-LD and Open Graph tags with Next SEO
- ⚙️ [Bundler Analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer)
- 💯 Maximize lighthouse score

### Philosophy

- All the Next.js pages are statically generated by default. You can easily switch to SSR adding `getServerSideProps` to your page.
- Nothing is hidden from you, so you have the freedom to make the necessary adjustments to fit your needs and preferences.
- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready

### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ITSS-Linux-System-Final-Project/typescript-nextjs-boilerplate.git
cd typescript-nextjs-boilerplate
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

Make sure to fill the env:
```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_API=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_LOCAL=
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell

```

### Rules before commit

Before commit, you have to run these commands and satisfy these requirements

```shell
yarn format     # This will format your whole code and make your code follow eslint rules to some extend
yarn lint       # This will return lint error in your files, make sure the result is OK
yarn test       # Make sure all test cases will have high coverage
```

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
yarn commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory `tests`.

You can run test with:
```shell
yarn test
```

You can turn on test coverage by change the line in file `jest.config.js`
```shell
 collectCoverage: true
```
### Changing Log

You can update your change log with this command

You can run test with:
```shell
yarn update-log
```

You can turn on test coverage by change the line in file `jest.config.js`
```shell
collectCoverage: true
```

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
